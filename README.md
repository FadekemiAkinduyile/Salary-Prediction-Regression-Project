# Salary-Prediction-Regression-Project

Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

**Dataset**

The LinkedIn Job Postings Dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings

**Description:**

The LinkedIn Job Postings dataset, collected over a span of two days, offers a rich and expansive repository of over 15,000 job postings. Each individual job posting within the dataset comprises 27 distinct attributes. The dataset's extensive scope presents a multitude of exploration possibilities (Kon, 2023).

**Problem Statement:**

In the competitive job landscape, hiring managers are faced with the challenge of making data-driven salary offers to job applicants. To address this challenge, the goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately estimates an individual's salary based on their experience level and other job-related features such as work type, benefits, and industry. This model will serve as a negotiation support system for hiring managers in the United States, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding an individual's salary.

**Machine Learning Solution:**

The project aims to develop a regression model that predicts a person's salary in the United States. The choice of regression is appropriate for predicting a continuous target variable like salary. The features considered include title, experience level, work type, benefits, and industry. These features are likely to have a significant impact on salary, making them valuable predictors for the model.
